## Introduction to Computer Vision
Computer Vision or CV is a field of study which seeks to enable algorithms and techniques that help a computer understand the contents of a digital image. While computer vision is often used in the context of Image Processing, the two of them are very distinct topics.

### Computer Vision vs Image Processing
Computer Vision can be classified as a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which may use generic learning algorithms or specialized methods, borrowed from a range of engineering studies. The goal of computer vision is to develop algorithms that replicate human behavior. On the other hand, Image Processing is a process of creating a new image from an existing image. Image Processing deals with enhancing and processing the information stored in an image, rather than understanding the content of the image. Examples of Image Processing include:
- Normalizing properties like brightness, contrast, hue and saturation.
- Cropping or removing parts of an image.
- Removing colors from an image, or changing the color space of an image.

### What is Computer Vision
From the perspective of engineering, Computer Vision seeks to understand and automate the tasks that a human visual system can perform. A successful computer vision system can perform tasks including but not restricted to data acquisition, processing, analysis, and understanding of digital images to derive high-dimensional data to produce information that can be used to make decisions. The image data may take many forms like single images, sequences of images in form of a video, multi-view images, multi-dimensional data in form of 3d images, or even digital signals.
Some of the most common tasks in computer vision are scene reconstruction, object detection, event or action detection, video tracking, object recognition, motion estimation, depth estimation, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.

### Applications of Computer Vision
While a lot of academic research has been done in the field of computer vision, the field today is not limited to academic research. Computer vision techniques are now being deployed to help with numerous real-world problems in the fields of business, entertainment, transportation, and healthcare. Here are a few tracks where computer vision is currently being used to help numerous industries:
- Image Classification: A computer vision model can distinguish between images, and can accurately predict whether a given image belongs to a certain class. Such models can be used by e-commerce websites to segregate various products into different categories.
- Object Detection: Computer vision models can detect objects in an image and classify them into their respective classes. These models play a very big role in security and surveillance firms.
- Object Tracking: These models can track or follow a detected object in a sequence of frames or videos. Tracking models are being used in sports industries and analytics to track players or objects in a match.
- Image Restoration: Vision models can restore damaged images, increase image resolution, add realistic color to grayscale images, and perform other similar tasks. These models are being used by media companies to provide solutions to real-world problems.
